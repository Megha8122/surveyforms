🚀 GitHub Showcase: Survey Form Project 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub page where I proudly present the first step of my certification journey with FreeCodeCamp – a dynamic and engaging survey form website built using HTML and CSS!

Project Snapshot:

HTML Mastery: Delve into the world of HTML as I structure the survey form, creating a foundation that captures user input seamlessly. Witness how semantic tags are strategically employed for clarity and accessibility.

CSS Styling Brilliance: Experience the transformation as CSS takes center stage to stylize the survey form. From color schemes to layout, every design decision is crafted with precision to ensure a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

FreeCodeCamp Guidance: None of this would be possible without the invaluable guidance and resources provided by FreeCodeCamp. The structured lessons and challenges have played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding of web development.

🔗 Explore the Code: Dive into the codebase, dissect the HTML and CSS files, and gain insights into the development process. Use this project not only as a learning resource but also as a source of inspiration for your own web development endeavors.

🌟 Certification Journey Begins: This project marks the initial step in my certification journey with FreeCodeCamp. Stay tuned for more exciting projects and milestones as I progress through the certification program.
